# Project Progress: Fasten On-Prem

## Current Status (Inferred from Project Structure)

The Fasten On-Prem project appears to be in a **mature stage of development**, with core functionalities established for both backend and frontend components.

*   **Foundation Built:**
    *   Backend (Go) and Frontend (Angular) applications are well-structured.
    *   Key infrastructure for build (Makefile, Nix), containerization (Docker), and dependency management (Go Modules, Yarn) is in place.
    *   Core features related to user authentication, medical data management (including FHIR), and UI for data interaction seem implemented.
    *   Multiple deployment environments (dev, prod, sandbox, desktop, cloud) are considered.
*   **Testing Frameworks:** Unit (Karma) and E2E (Protractor) testing setups are present in the frontend, indicating a commitment to quality assurance.
*   **Monorepo Management:** The project is organized as a monorepo, suggesting established practices for managing inter-component dependencies and builds.

## Completed Milestones (Inferred)

*   Initial setup of backend and frontend applications.
*   Implementation of core user authentication and authorization flows.
*   Development of key modules for medical data handling (e.g., medical history, lab reports, FHIR integration).
*   Creation of a comprehensive set of UI components for data display and interaction.
*   Establishment of build, testing, and deployment pipelines (Docker, Nix, Makefile).
*   Configuration for multiple deployment environments.
*   Refactoring of the mDNS (Zeroconf) service for improved robustness, configurability, and maintainability.

## Ongoing Activities / Immediate Next Steps (General Project)

*   **Memory Bank Updated (Fasten Lighthouse & Provider Sources):** The Memory Bank documentation has been updated to include detailed information about the purpose, architectural role, and technical mechanisms of Fasten Lighthouse in the authentication flow, and to clarify that the provider source catalog is defined in the separate `fastenhealth/fasten-sources` repository and served via Lighthouse.
*   **Maintenance & Bug Fixing:** Ongoing efforts to maintain the existing codebase and address any identified issues.
*   **Dependency Updates:** Regular review and updating of backend and frontend dependencies.

## Potential Future Phases / Long-Term Goals

*   **New Feature Development:**
    *   Expanding the range of supported medical data sources.
    *   Adding advanced analytics or reporting features.
    *   Enhancing user customization options for dashboards and views.
    *   Developing new modules based on user feedback or evolving healthcare needs.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Profiling and optimizing backend and frontend performance as the data volume and user base grow.
*   **Security Enhancements:** Continuous review and strengthening of security measures, especially given the sensitive nature of health data.
*   **Scalability Improvements:** Ensuring the architecture can scale to handle more users and larger datasets.
*   **Documentation Expansion:** Beyond the memory bank, detailed API documentation, user guides, and developer onboarding materials.
*   **Community Building / Open Source Contributions (if applicable):** If the project has an open-source aspect, fostering a community and managing contributions.
*   **Refinement of Desktop/Cloud Offerings:** Further development and differentiation of the desktop and cloud deployment models.

This progress document should be updated as the project evolves and new milestones are reached or new strategic directions are set.
